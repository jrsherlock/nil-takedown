# Find Next Opportunity Button - Implementation Fix

## Summary
Fixed the "Find Next Opportunity 💰" button functionality to properly generate and display new random events when clicked.

## Changes Made

### 1. **src/store/gameStore.ts**

#### Updated `generateRandomEvent()` function:
- **Changed return type**: Now returns `boolean` to indicate success/failure
- **Improved event filtering**: Changed from `history.includes(event.title)` to `history.startsWith(event.title + ':')` for more precise matching
- **Added state caching**: Store `get()` result in a variable to avoid multiple calls
- **Added return values**:
  - Returns `true` when a new event is successfully generated
  - Returns `false` when all events have been played
- **Better state management**: Explicitly sets `currentEvent` to `null` when no events are available

#### Updated TypeScript interface:
- Changed `generateRandomEvent: () => void` to `generateRandomEvent: () => boolean` in the `GameStore` interface

### 2. **src/pages/GameScreen.tsx**

#### Added toast notifications:
- Imported `toast` from `react-hot-toast`
- Added success toast when a new event is found: "💰 New opportunity found!"
- Added informative toast when all events are exhausted: "🎉 You've experienced all available events! Time to advance to the next year!"

#### Enhanced `handleNextEvent()` function:
- Now captures the return value from `generateRandomEvent()`
- Displays appropriate toast notification based on success/failure
- Provides clear user feedback for both scenarios

#### Enhanced `handleAdvanceYear()` function:
- Captures return value from `generateRandomEvent()`
- Shows success toast when new year starts with events available

#### Improved button UI:
- Added `motion.button` with Framer Motion animations
- Added `whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}` for hover effect
- Added `whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}` for click feedback
- Added `font-semibold` for better visual hierarchy

## How It Works

### Event Generation Flow:
1. User clicks "Find Next Opportunity 💰" button
2. `handleNextEvent()` is called
3. `generateRandomEvent()` executes:
   - Filters `gameEvents` array to exclude already-played events
   - Checks `eventHistory` using `startsWith(event.title + ':')` for precise matching
   - If available events exist:
     - Randomly selects one event
     - Sets it as `currentEvent`
     - Returns `true`
   - If no events available:
     - Sets `currentEvent` to `null`
     - Returns `false`
4. Based on return value, appropriate toast notification is shown
5. If successful, `EventCard` component automatically renders with the new event

### Event History Tracking:
- When a choice is made, the event is added to history as: `"${event.title}: ${choice.consequence}"`
- The filtering uses `startsWith(event.title + ':')` to match the exact event title
- This prevents the same event from appearing twice in the same playthrough

### User Feedback:
- ✨ Success toast: Confirms new opportunity was found
- 🏆 Info toast: Informs user all events are exhausted and suggests advancing year
- Button animations: Visual feedback on hover and click
- Smooth transitions: EventCard appears with fade-in animation

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Basic Functionality:**
- [ ] Click "Find Next Opportunity 💰" button
- [ ] Verify new event card appears
- [ ] Verify success toast notification appears
- [ ] Verify event has title, description, and 3 choices

✅ **Event Filtering:**
- [ ] Make a choice on an event
- [ ] Click "Find Next Opportunity 💰" again
- [ ] Verify the same event doesn't appear immediately
- [ ] Continue until all 6 events are played

✅ **All Events Exhausted:**
- [ ] Play through all 11 available events
- [ ] Click "Find Next Opportunity 💰" button
- [ ] Verify toast appears: "You've experienced all available events!"
- [ ] Verify no event card appears
- [ ] Advance to next year
- [ ] Verify events become available again

✅ **Visual Feedback:**
- [ ] Hover over button - should scale up slightly
- [ ] Click button - should scale down slightly
- [ ] Toast notifications appear at top-center
- [ ] EventCard has smooth fade-in animation

✅ **Edge Cases:**
- [ ] Rapid clicking the button (should handle gracefully)
- [ ] Button works after transferring schools
- [ ] Button works in different years
- [ ] Initial event loads automatically after 1 second

## Available Events (11 total)
1. The Secret Meeting
2. Social Media Oops
3. Practice vs. Payday
4. Booster Bidding War
5. The Transfer Portal Beckons
6. Crypto Deal Gone Wrong
7. The Viral TikTok Opportunity
8. FloWrestling Wants You Live
9. Challenge Spencer Lee?!
10. AJ Ferrari Collaboration
11. NCAA Compliance "Chat"

## Technical Details

### Event History Format:
```typescript
eventHistory: [
  "The Secret Meeting: You pocket the cash but your current school is suspicious. Worth it!",
  "Social Media Oops: Nobody believes you, but the damage is minimal.",
  // ... etc
]
```

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
const availableEvents = gameEvents.filter(event => 
  !state.eventHistory.some(history => history.startsWith(event.title + ':'))
)
```

This ensures exact title matching and prevents false positives from partial string matches.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add more events to increase variety
- Implement event cooldown system (events can repeat after X turns)
- Add event rarity system (common, rare, legendary events)
- Track event statistics (most chosen options, etc.)
- Add event prerequisites based on player stats
- Implement year-specific events
- Add seasonal or school-specific events

## Development Server
The game is running at: http://localhost:5175/

To test the changes:
1. Start a new game
2. Select a school
3. Wait for initial event or click "Find Next Opportunity 💰"
4. Make choices and verify new events generate correctly
