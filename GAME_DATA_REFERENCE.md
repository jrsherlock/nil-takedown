## Technical Notes for Developers

### Adding New Events
1. Add event object to `gameEvents` array in `gameStore.ts`
2. Follow existing structure (id, title, description, choices)
3. Each choice needs: text, effects, consequence
4. Effects can include: money, loyalty, clout, skill
5. Event IDs must be unique

### Adding New Schools
1. Add school object to `schools` array in `gameStore.ts`
2. Required fields: id, name, mascot, coach, coachDescription, vibe, nilSpecialty, startingBonus, color
3. Update `getColorClasses` in `SchoolCard.tsx` if adding new color

### Adding New Achievements
1. Add trigger logic in `processChoice` function
2. Check if achievement already exists before adding
3. Use `addAchievement` action
4. Display in `EndingScreen.tsx` and `GameScreen.tsx`

### Modifying Endings
1. Update `getEndingData` function in `EndingScreen.tsx`
2. Adjust money thresholds as needed
3. Update title, subtitle, description, colors, icon

---

## Data Export Format

All game data is currently hardcoded in `src/store/gameStore.ts`. For easier management, consider extracting to JSON files:

```
src/data/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schools.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ achievements.json
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ endings.json
```

This would allow non-developers to modify game content without touching TypeScript code.
