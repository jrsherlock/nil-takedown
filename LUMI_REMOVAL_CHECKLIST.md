# Lumi Dependency Removal - Quick Checklist

## Summary
Your project is **99% Lumi-independent already**! The Lumi SDK is installed but completely unused in the code. This checklist will help you remove the remaining 1% in under 10 minutes.

---

## âœ… Step-by-Step Removal Process

### Step 1: Remove Lumi SDK Package (1 minute)
```bash
pnpm remove @lumi.new/sdk
```

**What this does:**
- Removes `@lumi.new/sdk` from `package.json` dependencies
- Updates `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Removes package from `node_modules`

**Impact:** None - the package is never imported or used

---

### Step 2: Delete Unused Lumi Client File (1 minute)
```bash
rm src/lib/lumi.ts
```

**What this does:**
- Deletes the 10-line file that creates a Lumi client
- This file is never imported anywhere in your codebase

**Impact:** None - the file is dead code

**Optional:** If `src/lib/` directory is now empty and you don't plan to add utility files there:
```bash
rmdir src/lib
```

---

### Step 3: Replace Lumi Favicon (3-5 minutes)

**Option A: Quick Fix (Remove favicon entirely)**

Edit `index.html` line 5:
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<link rel="icon" href="https://lumi.new/lumi.ing/logo.png" />

<!-- AFTER (remove the line entirely) -->
```

**Option B: Better Fix (Use placeholder)**

Edit `index.html` line 5:
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<link rel="icon" href="https://lumi.new/lumi.ing/logo.png" />

<!-- AFTER -->
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

Then create a simple favicon later (see Step 4).

---

### Step 4: Create Custom Favicon (Optional, 10-30 minutes)

**Quick Method - Use Emoji as Favicon:**

1. Create `public/` directory if it doesn't exist:
```bash
mkdir -p public
```

2. Create `public/favicon.svg` with this content:
```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <text y="75" font-size="75">ðŸ’°</text>
</svg>
```

3. Update `index.html`:
```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
```

**Better Method - Use Favicon Generator:**
1. Visit https://favicon.io/ or https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Create a wrestling/money-themed icon
3. Download the generated files
4. Place in `public/` directory
5. Update `index.html` with the provided code

---

## ðŸ§ª Verification Steps

After completing the removal, verify everything still works:

### 1. Clean Install
```bash
# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

### 2. Check for Lumi References
```bash
# Search for any remaining Lumi references
grep -r "lumi" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" src/

# Should return: no results (or only comments if you added any)
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 and verify:
- âœ… Game loads without errors
- âœ… All screens work (Start â†’ Recruitment â†’ School Selection â†’ Game â†’ Ending)
- âœ… Stats update correctly
- âœ… Events trigger properly
- âœ… Transfer portal works
- âœ… Game can be completed

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
pnpm build
```

Should complete without errors and create `dist/` directory.

### 5. Preview Production Build
```bash
pnpm preview
```

Test the production build to ensure everything works.

## ðŸ“‹ Final Checklist

- [ ] Removed `@lumi.new/sdk` from package.json
- [ ] Deleted `src/lib/lumi.ts`
- [ ] Updated or removed favicon reference in `index.html`
- [ ] (Optional) Created custom favicon
- [ ] Verified no Lumi references remain in source code
- [ ] Tested development server
- [ ] Tested production build
- [ ] Game fully functional

---

## ðŸš€ What's Next?

Once Lumi dependencies are removed, you're ready to:

1. **Deploy the game** (see PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md section 10)
   - Recommended: Vercel or Netlify
   - Just connect your Git repo and deploy

2. **Add enhancements** (see PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md section 9)
   - localStorage for game saves
   - More events and achievements
   - Mobile optimization
   - Analytics

3. **Share your game!**
   - The game is fully functional and ready for players
   - No backend or database needed
   - Works entirely in the browser

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found: @lumi.new/sdk"
**Solution:** You likely have a stale import somewhere. Run:
```bash
grep -r "@lumi.new/sdk" src/
```
Remove any imports found.

### Issue: Favicon not showing
**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- Check that favicon file exists in `public/` directory
- Verify path in `index.html` is correct

### Issue: Build fails after removing Lumi SDK
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen since the SDK was unused. If it does:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm build` again

---

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during the removal process:

1. Check that you're in the project root directory
2. Ensure you have the latest version of pnpm/npm
3. Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling
4. Check the browser console for any error messages
5. Verify all files are saved before running commands

---

## âœ¨ Success!

Once you've completed these steps, your project will be **100% Lumi-independent** and ready for deployment on any static hosting platform. The game is fully functional, well-structured, and maintainable.

**Total estimated time: 5-10 minutes** (excluding optional favicon creation)
