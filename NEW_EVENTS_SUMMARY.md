## Design Philosophy

### Satirical Themes Covered:
1. **Social Media Culture** - TikTok influencer challenges and viral content
2. **Wrestling Media** - FloWrestling and the NIL discussion circus
3. **Celebrity Challenges** - Calling out Olympic champions for clout
4. **Controversial Partnerships** - High-risk, high-reward influencer collabs
5. **NCAA Compliance** - The absurdity of NIL rules and enforcement

### Balance Considerations:

**Money Range:**
- Minimum: -$50,000 (NCAA lawyer fees)
- Maximum: +$120,000 (FloWrestling live auction)
- Average positive: ~$60,000

**Loyalty Impact:**
- Most negative: -70% (FloWrestling auction)
- Most positive: +20% (FloWrestling technique talk)
- High-money choices typically hurt loyalty

**Clout Range:**
- Minimum: -5,000 (Spencer Lee hack claim)
- Maximum: +30,000 (AJ Ferrari full send)
- Social media events provide highest clout gains

**Skill Impact:**
- Most negative: -15% (Spencer Lee challenge)
- Most positive: +20% (TikTok decline)
- Wrestling-focused choices reward skill

### Gameplay Impact:

**Event Variety:**
- Players now have 11 unique events per playthrough
- More strategic choices between money, loyalty, clout, and skill
- Increased replayability with different paths

**Thematic Depth:**
- Events reference real wrestling culture (Spencer Lee, AJ Ferrari, FloWrestling)
- Satirizes modern NIL landscape and social media influence
- Balances humor with meaningful gameplay decisions

**Risk/Reward Profiles:**
- **High Risk, High Reward:** FloWrestling auction, AJ Ferrari collab
- **Safe Plays:** Decline TikTok, ghost AJ Ferrari
- **Balanced Options:** Charity Spencer Lee event, clean AJ collab
- **Unique Mechanics:** NCAA event has negative money options

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Event Distribution:** Verify all 11 events can appear randomly
2. **Balance Testing:** Ensure no single event is overpowered
3. **Narrative Flow:** Check that consequences feel appropriate
4. **Edge Cases:** Test with extreme stat values (0% loyalty, max money)
5. **Replayability:** Confirm events don't repeat until all are played

---

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add year-specific events (freshman vs. senior year)
- School-specific events based on current school
- Stat-gated events (only appear if you have high clout/money)
- Multi-part event chains (decisions in one event affect future events)
- Seasonal events (tournament season, off-season)
- Rival wrestler events (ongoing feuds)
