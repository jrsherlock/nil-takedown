# Quick Start Guide - Bo Basset's NIL Takedown

## üéØ What You Need to Know Right Now

### Project Status: ‚úÖ READY TO GO
- **Game is 100% functional** - All features work perfectly
- **99% Lumi-independent** - Only 3 trivial cleanup items remain
- **No backend needed** - Runs entirely in browser
- **Ready to deploy** - Can go live in 15 minutes

---

## üìã Your Next 3 Steps (10 minutes total)

### Step 1: Remove Lumi Dependencies (5 min)
```bash
# Remove the unused SDK package
pnpm remove @lumi.new/sdk

# <link rel="icon" href="https://lumi.new/lumi.ing/logo.png" />
# To this:
# <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```

### Step 2: Test Everything (3 min)
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install

# Run dev server
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173 and play through the game

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

### Step 3: Deploy (2 min)
```bash
# Option A: Deploy to Vercel
npx vercel

# Option B: Connect GitHub repo to Vercel/Netlify dashboard

## üéÆ How the Game Works

### Game Flow
```
Start Screen
    ‚Üì
Recruitment Screen (narrative)
    ‚Üì
School Selection (choose from 4 schools)
    ‚Üì
Game Screen (events + choices + stats)
    ‚Üì (after 4 years)
Ending Screen (based on total earnings)
```

### Key Files to Know

**State Management:**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` - All game logic and data (368 lines)

**Pages (5 screens):**
- `src/pages/StartScreen.tsx` - Player name entry
- `src/pages/RecruitmentScreen.tsx` - Narrative intro
- `src/pages/SchoolSelection.tsx` - Choose school
- `src/pages/GameScreen.tsx` - Main gameplay
- `src/pages/EndingScreen.tsx` - Results

**Components:**
- `src/components/StatsPanel.tsx` - Shows player stats
- `src/components/EventCard.tsx` - Event choices UI
- `src/components/TransferPortal.tsx` - School switching
- `src/components/SchoolCard.tsx` - School selection cards
- `src/components/GameLayout.tsx` - Layout wrapper

## üîë Key Findings About Lumi

### What Lumi Provided ‚úÖ
- Initial project scaffolding (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- Standard configuration files
- Package.json with good dependencies
- The `@lumi.new/sdk` package (unused)
- The `src/lib/lumi.ts` file (unused)

### What Lumi Did NOT Control ‚úÖ
- **All game logic** - 100% custom
- **All UI components** - 100% custom
- **State management** - Pure Zustand
- **Routing** - Standard React Router
- **Build process** - Standard Vite

### Bottom Line
**Lumi gave you a great starting template, but all the actual game code is yours and completely independent!**

## üí° Important Notes

### The Game is Feature-Complete
- All 5 screens work perfectly
- All 6 events are implemented
- All 4 schools are functional
- Transfer portal works
- Stats tracking works
- Achievements work
- All 4 endings work

### What's NOT Implemented (Optional Enhancements)
- Game save/load (no localStorage yet)
- Sound effects
- Additional events beyond the 6
- Leaderboard (would need backend)
- Social sharing

### No Backend Needed
- Everything runs in the browser
- No database required
- No API calls
- No authentication
- Pure static site

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Recommended: Vercel (Easiest)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your GitHub repo
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done! You get a live URL

### Alternative: Netlify
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to netlify.com
3. Click "Add new site"
4. Select your GitHub repo
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done!

### Other Options
- GitHub Pages (free for public repos)
- Cloudflare Pages (fast CDN)
- Any static hosting service

## üéØ What to Work on Next

### Immediate (After Lumi Removal)
1. Create a custom favicon (wrestling/money themed)
2. Test on mobile devices
3. Deploy to production
4. Share with friends!

### Short-term Enhancements
1. Add localStorage to save game progress
2. Create 5-10 more events
3. Add more achievements
4. Add sound effects (optional)
5. Improve mobile UI

### Long-term Ideas
1. Leaderboard system (needs backend)
2. User-submitted events
3. Multiple game modes
4. Expanded school roster
5. Season performance tracking

## üîç Quick Code Reference

### Adding a New Event
Edit `src/store/gameStore.ts`, add to `gameEvents` array:
```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  title: 'Event Title',
  description: 'What happens...',
  choices: [
    {
      text: 'Choice 1',
      effects: { money: 50000, loyalty: -20 },
      consequence: 'What happens after...'
    },
    // ... more choices
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New School
Edit `src/store/gameStore.ts`, add to `schools` array:
```typescript
{
  id: 'school-id',
  name: 'School Name',
  mascot: 'ü¶Ö',
  coach: 'Coach Name',
  coachDescription: 'Description...',
  vibe: 'School vibe...',
  nilSpecialty: 'What they offer',
  startingBonus: 50000,
  color: 'blue'
}
```

### Adding a New Achievement
Edit `src/store/gameStore.ts`, add logic in `processChoice`:
```typescript
if (newPlayer.someCondition && !player.achievements.includes('Achievement Name')) {
  get().addAchievement('Achievement Name')
}
```

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" after removing Lumi SDK
**Solution:** Delete `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`, then run `pnpm install`

### Issue: Game resets when I refresh the page
**Solution:** This is expected - no localStorage yet. Add it as an enhancement!

### Issue: Favicon not showing
**Solution:** Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution:** 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules dist
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

- [ ] Read this Quick Start guide
- [ ] Skim PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for technical details
- [ ] Follow LUMI_REMOVAL_CHECKLIST.md (5-10 min)
- [ ] Test the game locally (`pnpm dev`)
- [ ] Build for production (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Share the game!

After deployment:
- [ ] Review GAME_DATA_REFERENCE.md for content details
- [ ] Plan your first enhancements
- [ ] Add localStorage for game saves
- [ ] Create more events
- [ ] Improve mobile experience

## üéâ You're Ready!

Your game is **fully functional** and **ready to deploy**. The Lumi dependencies are trivial to remove (5-10 minutes), and then you'll have a completely independent, production-ready game.

**Next command to run:**
```bash
pnpm remove @lumi.new/sdk
```

Then follow the LUMI_REMOVAL_CHECKLIST.md for the remaining 2 steps.

**Good luck, and have fun with your NIL Takedown game! üí∞ü§º**
